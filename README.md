# Calculator Project

This is a project I am building in the Nebula Academy SEV12 program. This is a vintage 80s style calculator with a flip screen and basic functionality for everyday people's needs. When I enter my favorite number "22++" the calculator displays "Hi Dennis". When one enters 9999XX the calculator closes.
